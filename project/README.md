# Description of Work (10 points)

We ask you to include a file called `README.md` that contains a quick description of:

1. the design choices you made,
2. any problems you encountered while creating your solution, and
3. your solutions to those problems.

This is not meant to be comprehensive; less than 300 words will suffice.
